# Getting Started <br/>
Warehouse automation is all about uncovering repetitive tasks and finding ways to automate them. Modern warehouses are full of cases – from manual data entry to picking, storing and shipping of goods done by hand.<br/>

Manual operations go hand in hand with human errors resulting in delays, improper time and resource management, low productivity and margin. All this ultimately leads to unsatisfied business partners and customers.<br/>

### Some of the areas that warehouse automation can improve operations include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>Reducing operating expenses, overhead and unnecessary costs from errors</li>
    <li>Protecting the company’s assets, brand and reputation with customers and partners</li>
    <li>Increasing efficiency and productivity of human resources</li>
    <li>Minimizing manual processes and handling of stock keeping units (SKU)</li>
    <li>Maximizing warehouse space utilization, layout and flow</li>
   <li> Coordinating usage of material handling equipment (MHE), such as barcode scanners and mobile computers</li>
</ul>
